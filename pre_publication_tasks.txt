Tasks to be completed before publication of the corpora
========================================================

Change uh@s:cym&spa to y@s:cym&spa
Change um@s:cym&spa to ym@s:cym&spa
(Update: these could be added to a final stage of the autoglossing process, so that they do not need to be handled as a separate task.  KD to take forward.)

Run final CHECK and CHATTER on all files.
