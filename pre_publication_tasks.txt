Tasks to be completed before publication of the corpora
========================================================

Change uh@s:cym&spa to y@s:cym&spa
Change um@s:cym&spa to ym@s:cym&spa
(Update: these could be added to a final stage of the autoglossing process, so that they do not need to be handled as a separate task.  KD to take forward.)

Review Welsh/Spanish cognates.
JS to take forward. 
(Update: in progress - MD reviewing.)

Review changing 'ajÃ¡' marked as Spanish to 'aha@s:eng&spa'.

Review list of POS-tags - one list for both corpora?  remove language-specific examples?

Change xxx -> [...].
Change "gonna" to "going to".

Run final CHECK on all files.
