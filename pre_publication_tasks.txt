Tasks to be completed before publication of the corpora
========================================================

Change uh@s:cym&spa to y@s:cym&spa
Change um@s:cym&spa to ym@s:cym&spa
(Update: these could be added to a final stage of the autoglossing process, so that they do not need to be handled as a separate task.  KD to take forward.)

Review Welsh/Spanish cognates.
JS to take forward. 
(Update: in progress - MD reviewing.)

Review list of POS-tags - one list for both corpora?  remove language-specific examples?

Review language spec in headers of Miami files, and adopt a consistent criterion (eg marked as Spanish when more than 40% of the words are in Spanish).
KD to work out a way of automatically changing the file formatting from predominantly-X to predominantly-Y.

Run final CHECK on all files.
